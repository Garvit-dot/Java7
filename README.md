# Java7
This is a simple multi-file Java Calculator application that supports various mathematical operations such as:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Square
- Cube
- Square Root

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile all `.java` files:
      

**Method Descriptions-:**
**Addition.java** : Adds two numbers and returns the result.
**Subtraction.java** : Subtracts the second number from the first and returns the result.
**Multiplication.java** : Multiplies two numbers and returns the result.
**Division.java** : Divides the first number by the second.
                Uses exception handling to prevent division by zero.
**Square.java** : Returns the square of a number.
**Cube.java** : Returns the cube of a number.
**SquareRoot.java** : returns square root of a number.
                  Throws and handles exception if the input is negative.



**Exception Handling -:**
The application uses built-in Java exceptions such as:
ArithmeticException: For division by zero and square root of a negative number.
InputMismatchException: Handled during user input to avoid crashing on invalid types.

**Coding Guidelines Followed -:**
Separate classes for each functionality.
Descriptive method names.
Inbuilt exception handling.
Proper comments for logical blocks.
Simple and readable code structure.

Future Enhancements (Optional Ideas)-:
GUI version using Swing or JavaFX.
Add history feature to track previous calculations.
Support for more operations like power, modulo, factorial, etc.
